# Kedro for notebook users


You can take advantage of a notebook's liberal development environment for exploratory data analysis and experimentation from within a Kedro project. Later, when you need to follow software best practices as the project complexity increases, or as you scale into production, you can transfer code from the notebook into Kedro to benefit from its opinionated project framework.
