# Default framework-side logging configuration

Kedro's [default logging configuration](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/blob/main/kedro/framework/project/default_logging.yml) defines a handler called `rich` that uses the [Rich logging handler](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/logging.html) to format messages. We also use the [Rich traceback handler](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/traceback.html) to render exceptions.

By default, Python only shows logging messages at level `WARNING` and above. Kedro's logging configuration specifies that `INFO` level messages from Kedro should also be emitted. This makes it easier to track the progress of your pipeline when you perform a `kedro run`.

## Project-side logging configuration

In addition to the `rich` handler defined in Kedro's framework, the [project-side `conf/base/logging.yml`](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/blob/main/kedro/templates/project/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.repo_name%20%7D%7D/conf/base/logging.yml) defines two further logging handlers:
* `console`: show logs on standard output (typically your terminal screen) without any rich formatting
* `info_file_handler`: write logs of level `INFO` and above to `info.log`

The logging handlers that are actually used by default are `rich` and `info_file_handler`.

The project-side logging configuration also ensures that [logs emitted from your project's logger](#perform-logging-in-your-project) should be shown if they are `INFO` level or above (as opposed to the Python default of `WARNING`).

We now give some common examples of how you might like to change your project's logging configuration.

### Using `KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG` environment variable

`KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG` is an optional environment variable that you can use to specify the path of your logging configuration file, overriding the default Kedro's `default_logging.yml`.

To use this environment variable, set it to the path of your desired logging configuration file before running any Kedro commands. For example, if you have a logging configuration file located at `/path/to/logging.yml`, you can set `KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG` as follows:

```bash
export KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG=/path/to/logging.yml
```

After setting the environment variable, any subsequent Kedro commands will use the logging configuration file at the specified path.

```{note}
If the `KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG` environment variable is not set, Kedro will default to using the logging configuration file at the project's default location of  Kedro's `default_logging.yml`.
```
### Disable file-based logging

You might sometimes need to disable file-based logging, e.g. if you are running Kedro on a read-only file system such as [Databricks Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html). The simplest way to do this is to delete your `conf/base/logging.yml` file. With no project-side logging configuration specified, Kedro uses the default framework-side logging configuration, which does not include any file-based handlers.

Alternatively, if you would like to keep other configuration in `conf/base/logging.yml` and just disable file-based logging, then you can remove the file-based handlers from the `root` logger as follows:
```diff
 root:
-  handlers: [console, info_file_handler]
+  handlers: [console]
```

### Customise the `rich` Handler

Kedro's `kedro.extras.logging.RichHandler` is a subclass of [`rich.logging.RichHandler`](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/logging.html#rich.logging.RichHandler) and supports the same set of arguments. By default, `rich_tracebacks` is set to `True` to use `rich` to render exceptions. However, you can disable it by setting `rich_tracebacks: False`.

```{note}
If you want to disable `rich`'s tracebacks, you must set `KEDRO_LOGGING_CONFIG` to point to your local config i.e. `conf/base/logging.yml`.
```

When `rich_tracebacks` is set to `True`, the configuration is propagated to [`rich.traceback.install`](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/traceback.html#rich.traceback.install). If an argument is compatible with `rich.traceback.install`, it will be passed to the traceback's settings.

For instance, you can enable the display of local variables inside `logging.yml` to aid with debugging.

```yaml
rich:
  class: kedro.extras.logging.RichHandler
  rich_tracebacks: True
  tracebacks_show_locals: True
```

A comprehensive list of available options can be found in the [RichHandler documentation](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/logging.html#rich.logging.RichHandler).


### Use plain console logging

To use plain rather than rich logging, swap the `rich` handler for the `console` one as follows:

```diff
 root:
-  handlers: [rich, info_file_handler]
+  handlers: [console, info_file_handler]
```

### Rich logging in a dumb terminal

Rich [detects whether your terminal is capable](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/console.html#terminal-detection) of displaying richly formatted messages. If your terminal is "dumb" then formatting is automatically stripped out so that the logs are just plain text. This is likely to happen if you perform `kedro run` on CI (e.g. GitHub Actions or CircleCI).

If you find that the default wrapping of the log messages is too narrow but do not wish to switch to using the `console` logger on CI then the simplest way to control the log message wrapping is through altering the `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables. For example:

```bash
export COLUMNS=120 LINES=25
```

```{note}
You must provide a value for both `COLUMNS` and `LINES` even if you only wish to change the width of the log message. Rich's default values for these variables are `COLUMNS=80` and `LINE=25`.
```

### Rich logging in Jupyter

Rich also formats the logs in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook. The size of the output console does not adapt to your window but can be controlled through the `JUPYTER_COLUMNS` and `JUPYTER_LINES` environment variables. The default values (115 and 100 respectively) should be suitable for most users, but if you require a different output console size then you should alter the values of `JUPYTER_COLUMNS` and `JUPYTER_LINES`.

## Perform logging in your project

To perform logging in your own code (e.g. in a node), you are advised to do as follows:

```python
import logging

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
log.warning("Issue warning")
log.info("Send information")
```

```{note}
The name of a logger corresponds to a key in the `loggers`  section in `logging.yml` (e.g. `kedro`). See [Python's logging documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logger-objects) for more information.
```

You can take advantage of rich's [console markup](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/markup.html) when enabled in your logging calls:
```python
log.error("[bold red blink]Important error message![/]", extra={"markup": True})
```
