# Visualisation with Kedro-Viz


[Kedro-Viz](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz) is a key part of Kedro. It visualises the pipelines in a Kedro project by showing data, nodes, and the connections between them.

The Kedro-Viz package needs to be installed separately as it is not part of the standard Kedro installation:

```bash
pip install kedro-viz
```

```{toctree}
